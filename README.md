1.	How do I approach designing software?

In the software design process, my initial step involves gathering and analyzing all the requirements to gain a comprehensive understanding of the project's objectives and scope. Once this analysis is complete, I prioritize and focus on the most critical objective. This approach has been instrumental in developing an efficient software development process. Moreover, this project has particularly enhanced my proficiency in modularizing code, enabling reusability. By ensuring that my code is easily comprehensible and maintainable, incorporating new objects and textures becomes simpler. Testing was also crucial throughout this project as there were many interactions and functions that could be affected through additional implementations. 

2.	How do I approach developing programs?

Developing a program with attention to detail and a systematic approach is crucial for ensuring its success. By iterating through new implementations and thoroughly verifying the rendering, placement, and texturing of the objects, I demonstrated my commitment to delivering a high-quality program. This approach allowed me to catch any potential errors or issues early on and make necessary adjustments.

3.	How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
   
To maximize the benefits of computer science, one must have the desire to continually improve upon oneâ€™s skills and knowledge. This course enhanced my ability to troubleshoot and design code that is reusable and modifiable. I gained new knowledge in the field of computer graphics and feel more confident in my ability to solve complex problems within interactive systems. Working with OpenGL to create a visual representation of 3D scenes and interactively working with the objects has broadened my scope of practical experience.
